            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a self-taught developer and aspiring data analyst with a passion for solving real-world
                problems through code, data, and smart design. Over the past year, I’ve committed myself fully
                to learning the tools and technologies that power modern solutions—investing 5–12 hours every
                day to master HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, SQL, Excel VBA, and more. With no formal degree
                or prior industry experience, I’ve built my skills from the ground up, guided only by
                curiosity, discipline, and a drive to create value. One of my proudest accomplishments was
                developing a modular accuracy dashboard used across 10 U.S. distribution centers, which helped
                streamline error tracking and received high praise from senior leadership for its clarity and
                impact. I bring a deep understanding of tools like Excel, Pivot Tables, Git, Tableau, and SQL,
                as well as strong communication skills honed through cross-functional collaboration. Whether
                I’m building front-end experiences, scripting backend logic, or analyzing messy data to
                surface insights, I care about getting things right—and getting them done. If you’re looking
                for someone who learns fast, takes initiative, and thrives in problem-solving environments,
                I’d love to connect.
